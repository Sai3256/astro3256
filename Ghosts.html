    <h1 align="center">A Sky Full of Ghosts</h1>
    <p>On a clear, dust free night in an area free of the lights from Urban areas. We may look up and see a sky filled with stars, little twinkling points in the dark that seem to fill the entirety of the sky. A significant part of the human civilization is people using the stars for valuable purposes; one may use known constellations to navigate inside a vast sea or use them to tell them the time of night. Astronomers across time and civilizations have spent countless hours working tireless to chart the very sky we look at today, recording notable events, known celestial objects which serves as a record to the curiosity humans had towards the night sky even years into the past</p>

<p>But when we look at the sky, we not only look at stars, we also peer into the past. Indeed, light is the fastest thing in the universe, but it is not infinitely fast. Light travels at a speed of three hundred thousand kilometers in a second, or beyond nine trillion kilometers in a year, but even that distance serves as a yardstick in the incomprehensible large scheme of our Cosmos.</p>
<p>How does this equate to looking into the past? Well, the distance from the moon to the earth is about as large as the distance light covers in a second, by that frame, the moon is one light second away. The sun, the engine that drives everything on our planet, is about 8 Light minutes away, Neptune, the farthest planet lies about 4 light hours away, the farthest human made object, lies about 1 light day away. But even a light day falls short of significance when we go beyond the solar system. The nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, lies about 4 light years away from the Earth, at that point all of the previous distances seem insignificant, our galaxy, the milky way is a hundred thousand light years across and to travel from start to the end of the observable universe, light would take nearly 14 billion years</p>
<h2 align="center">Windows to the Past</h2>
<p>When we look at a star in the night sky, we are actually looking at how it looked years into the past, when its light left its surface on its way to the Earth. Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star located inside the Orion constellation, is at a distance of about 650 light years from the Earth, indeed, when the star finally enters its death throes as a Supernova, we wouldn’t know about it for more than 500 years. Which brings us to a conclusion, many of the stars in the night sky might have already reached the end of their lives, yet there the light signaling their end is yet to arrive on the planet, what we see in the sky is a ghost, a window to the past, showing us the last glimpses of the star. Or for even more faraway stars, the time taken by their light to reach Earth is larger than the stars own lifespan, meaning we witness their birth after they have died, a statement that only makes sense considering the size of the Cosmos.

<p><small><i><center><font color="blue">iThe Hubble Ultra Deep field, each of those dots is an individual galaxy</font></center></i></small></p>
<p>The image we see here is named the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, an image of a small portion of the sky in the Fornax constellation taken in the year 2004. This image serves as an example of the above concept, what we peer into is a small portion of the sky, yet a giant window into the long distant past. Some of the Galaxies in the image are nearly 13 billion light years away, forming around 400-600 million years after the Big Bang when the universe itself was still in a stage of infancy. There was no life back then, or the Earth the Sun or the Milky Way for that matter. Through these images, what we see is a glimpse into a past that was violent yet led to the Universe as we know it today. All of this from a patch of sky a few degrees across in the Night Sky</p>
<p>The exploding Supernova in the galaxy NGC 2525 is an event that occurred 70 million years ago, a time when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. The Sombrero galaxy pictured here is 28 million light years away. The further pictured Mice Galaxies, are a pair of colliding Galaxies are 290 million years away, all of these galaxies had their light begin its journey towards the earth much before we walked on it, when our ancestors were but learning to step onto land. Moving beyond stars, moving beyond ghosts, space really is just a window to the past, while we try to find a future for ourselves within it.

<h2 align="center">Finding Order in Chaos</h2>
<p>But what if we change our perspective, what if we view the night sky as an unfolding of life rather than congregation of ghosts. Indeed, much of our understanding of how the Universe was in its early stages comes from observing extremely distant objects, a glance into the past that was unrelenting and chaotic and discordant. In the early universe, the very first galaxies and the very first stars and much different from the present-day stars and galaxies. Hydrogen was the solely major element in
    the universe, yet, the primordial universe was so dense with matter concentrated into a small space that any light could hardly pass through and the density of this matter was too uniform for gravity to pull clumps of matter together to form stars

<p>As the Universe expanded, we see ripples. Minute instances of non-uniformity that were present since the Big Bang, at the time of the origin of the Universe, these ripples were so small that they could not be considered any different than the uniformity of the matter that surrounded them. What is wonderful is, had the universe been uniform in its distribution of matter, we would never have existed, not stars, galaxies or Nebulae; The Universe would have continued being a primordial soup of hydrogen, unchanging, never taking form or evolving</p>
<p>The ripples of matter spread uniformly slowly grew larger and larger until gravity could cause the very first clumps of gas to form into the very first generation of stars. These stars were absolutely massive and rapidly burnt through their available Hydrogen reserves (interestingly, larger mass conversely applies to a smaller lifespan for Stars). And then, as these stars died, they sometimes formed massive blackholes, celestial objects that form when a supermassive star collapses under its own gravity, forming a tear through the very fabric of Space Time</p>

<p>In this image, the red spot is one of the very first galaxies formed in the universe. Primordial and irregular in nature, these galaxies are precursors to the many types of galaxies that exist today. The supermassive blackholes of those times still leave a glimpse into the present. Quasars, extremely distant celestial objects that were identified as star-like distant radio sources in the 1950’s, were later discovered to be extremely active galactic nuclei that occurred during the early phase of the universe, about 10 billion years ago.</p>

<h2 align="center">From Order to an End</h2>
<p>When we look at distant objects, may it be galaxies billions of light years away or super luminous objects like Quasars or even massive bodies like the Virgo Supercluster where our galaxy seems to be travelling to, we are utterly humbled by the size of the universe. The CMBR or the Cosmic Microwave
 
    Background Radiation, one of the earliest remnants of the big bang shows us the very edge of the observable universe, the end of what we can detect, bound by the shackles of time.

<p>
    Since then, the universe has evolved over the years. With its matter gradually being spread further and further apart so as to leave large pockets of intergalactic space and all matter being concentrated in smaller areas. The universe slowly started expanding around 9 billion years ago, somewhat around the time of the first Quasars and its expansion has only been accelerating since. Currently, galaxies have moved on their primordial ancestors and are much varied in shape, size and composition, raging from older and inert elliptical galaxies to hyperactive Seyfert Galaxies, like the Fried Egg galaxy pictured here. The universe is currently in a state of accelerated expansion and as time progresses continues to go towards a state of gradually increasing entropy.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not know what the future holds, whether the Universe would continue to expand under acceleration until all matter reaches a state of zero energy, a cold death. Or will the Universe implode upon itself in some distant future. We do not know if the observable universe is edge of everything or just the edge of what we can observe and we do not know if our perceived conceptions of space and time are absolute or not

    <h2 align="center">Towards a Future, Our Future</h2>
    <p>But if the night sky is filled with ghosts and unfolding life and windows to the past, it also contains a key to the future. William Herschel was one of the first astronomers to realize the concept that looking into the sky was peering back into time. Since then, science has evolved on the shoulders of many great figures, may it be the observations of Galileo and Kepler, the discovery of electromagnetism by faraday and its condensation into Mathematical form by Maxwell, or the work behind the revolutionary theory of relativity by Einstein. Today, we stand on the edge of what we have discovered so far, an edge to a different new future, a new upheaval of what we know about Space.</p>

<p>Humanity has come a long way from the days of our paleolithic ancestors looking at the sky at nighttime and theorizing as to what the stars can be. Some of them could have thought of them as deities or even omens, some of them would have thought of them as campfires. We would never know as this part of their history was never inscribed in Cave writings. How far have we come from them. How close are we to realizing the absolute nature of the Cosmos, how does the Universe end? What lies beyond the event horizon of a blackhole? Does the universe have a definable edge? There are so many questions we do not know the answer to, yet. However, we have just begun trying to reach out to what lies beyond the Fugue of our civilization what lies beyond the horizon of our knowledge.</p>

<p>In the end, the scale of the universe has always continued to humble us with its grand scales, stretching the very frontiers of space and time. However, humanity’s greatest strengths its dynamism, as a civilization, we have achieved more breakthroughs in science in the past 5 centuries than in the 1.5 million of years of human evolution. Perhaps we shall find a way to leave our humble shores of the cosmic ocean, perhaps we shall find answers to mysteries which are utterly incomprehensible to us today, and perhaps, we as a civilization will finally cross over the very planet that we call home, declaring all times before as infancy; and moving on to meet those ghosts in the sky, to not only peer into, but dive into those windows of the past. Our first echo towards the Cosmos.</p>
